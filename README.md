# mint-boy

Another gameboy advanced emulator, built for fun and leisure. I started this as a pet project and it turned into so much
more. As a gameboy advanced emulator mint-boy offers alot of customization and hooks into the actual emulator. You can
edit memory while the game is running, print current running statistics, add custom overlays full of useful information
and even control execution by controlling what instruction will be executed next. Useful and full of features for
hacking, mint-boy will help you  gain insight into a gameboy's hardware and ARM architecture.
